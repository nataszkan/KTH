# Node-api

_This is specifically written for the `coding-interview` branch. See the `main` branch for a general introduction of the repository._

## Instructions

Make sure that the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) are met, follow the steps in [Setup](#setup), and try out the application in [Getting started](#getting-started). Finally, try to solve the assignments in [Assignments](#assignments).

- Spend 1 hour on the assignments
- Please use at least one commit per assignment
- Add comments where needed
- Update tests if necessary, and feel free to add additional tests
- Share the repository with the KTH representative

If you run into problems, see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting). Contact the KTH representative if you have any questions.

## Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/commands/npm)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [GitHub account](https://github.com/join)

## Setup

- Create a new public repository with this repository ([KTH/node-api](https://github.com/KTH/node-api)) as a template
- Switch to branch `coding-interview`
- Install the dependencies with `npm i`
- Start a MongoDB server instance with `npm run mongo:start` (you can stop it with `npm run mongo:stop`)
- Start the application with `npm run start-dev` (the terminal should display something similar to [Example of log output on start](#example-of-log-output-on-start))
- Verify that the Swagger UI is available on http://localhost:3001/api/node/swagger/

## Getting started

- Authorization is managed with an `apiKey`. The default value is set to `1234` in `./config/serverSettings.js:19`. Press the _Authorize 🔓_ button in the Swagger UI, enter _1234_, press _Authorize_, and close the modal. Now, you can try the _GET /\_checkAPIkey_ endpoint. It will return response code `200` if you are authorized.
- Try to save data to the database with the _POST /v1/data/{id}_ endpoint
- Then, try to retrieve the same data with the _GET /v1/data/{id}_ endpoint

## Assignments

The assignments aim to add endpoints for full CRUD functionality.

1. Change the data endpoints to handle values with `firstName` and `lastName`, instead of just `name`. Example: `{ "name": "John Doe" }` to `{ "firstName": "John", "lastName": "Doe"}`
2. Add `PUT` and `DELETE` data endpoints
3. Refactor data endpoints to person endpoints. Example: _GET /v1/data/{id}_ to _GET /v1/person/{id}_

## References

### Troubleshooting

- If you have problems pushing, try `git push --no-verify`
